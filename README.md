# Word-Occurence-Text-Analysis
This code is meant to work as a way to computationally analyze literature.
Currently, the code looks through a given text file and searches for user-given words. It then designs a number line, starting with 0 as the first word of the text, and ending with whatever the last word of the text is. Every occurence of the user-given word is graphically displayed as a dot. In this way, one can analyze word usage over the course of a text.
